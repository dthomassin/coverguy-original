<h2>Read what our Great Customers are saying about their Hot Tub Covers and Spa Covers from The Cover Guy</h2>

<h3>Just a quick note to say thank you for a wonderful product.  I noticed the majority of the testimonials on the web site are from people who made recent orders.  My wife and I ordered a cover from The Cover Guy two years ago and it is still as nice as the day it came.  It is light but strong, keeps in the heat, and hasn't become water logged like the old cover we replaced.  I was just back on the site helping my father order a new cover for his hot tub because we are so happy with ours.  My father's first cover that came from another store didn't even last one year!  He lives in an area with a lot of snow and we told him he had to order from the Cover Guy this time!  Thanks again!

<h3>Hi there,
Just wanted to let you know that we have received our hot tub cover in good
order.  It is a great fit and we are very happy with your service.  I will
be sure to recommend you to others.

<h3>Just received my new cover only an hour after I got home from work and saw 
it had been shipped in my email! Fast delivery! Everyone I knew with tubs 
warned me against ordering on the internet for a cover sight unseen, but 
after setting it up, I will be letting them know about The Cover Guy. I 
saved some money and got the exact fit and color (unlike ones in town that 
were very limited).
My wife will be happy to be able to lift the cover again (as our other one 
was about 200 lbs. from water logging this winter).
Thanks for the new  cover!

<h3>Hello Cover Guy,

Our spa cover came today. It is in perfect condition, no shipping damage.

The truck driver, David, from California Express was very prompt, courteous 
and polite.

When we opened the box we found exactly what we ordered. The color is what 
we wanted and the fit is perfect!

The Cover Guy provides exactly what he advertises!

We will recommend the Cover Guy to anyone that we come across that is in 
need of a spa cover or other spa supplies.

Thank you for prompt courteous service!! Your system works.

<h3>Hi, Just wanted to let you know that we received the hot tub cover, and the cover lifter, and they work wonderfully. The top fit perfectly, and we got it installed just in time for a 14 foot snow storm. The spa cover took it like a real champ! Thank you so much!!!

<h3>Found your hot tub cover company on line and read the comments from other satisfied customers. This prompted me to order my replacement spa cover. The cover arrived this morning just as I was in the middle of some renovations. Things were not going good on that front!! However, I was extremely happy a few minutes later when I unpacked the hot tub cover and it fit like a glove. You folks did a fantastic job on the cover and I will recommend your spa cover company to all my friends. I am a career firefighter and many of our members own hot tubs. At one point, they will all need new hot tub covers. I will be your best salesperson!!!!!!!
<br>Respectfully yours, Paul - Grand Rapids, MI</h3>

<h2>More Spa Cover Praise</h2>

<h3>Dear Cover Guy, For the past week we have been enjoying the ease of taking our "cover Guy" hot tub cover off and on. Wow what a difference. Its efforts like yours that will perpetuate your companys success. I have 10 sibblings and 42 neices and nephews. Rest assured that I will sing your companys praises. Thanks, Larry a satisfied customer in north carolina. Just got the cover today...awesome! It fits great and may even be better than the original Hot Springs cover; certainly better than the one I bought just 4 years ago that disintegrated right before my eyes!
<br>Thanks, Dan Messersmith, Philadelphia, PA</h3>

<h3>Thanks to everyone at The Cover Guy! My new spa cover fit like a glove. The whole process from ordering the hot tub cover and confirming the cover order to the shipping of the hot tub cover was excellent. The new spa cover looks great and is so light. My old hot tub cover was so water logged I could hardly get it on an off. I weighed my old hot tub cover and it was 115 lbs. Thanks again!!!
